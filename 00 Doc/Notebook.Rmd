##**Introduction**

This page shows three different visualizations using Tableau. Each of them are different depictions of data from oil wells in Texas.

###R Configuration
Below we display our sessionInfo().
```{r sessionInfo}
sessionInfo(package=NULL)
```

###Downloading the CSV from data.world

To download our document, go to https://data.world/mwillett/s-17-edv-project-3, and click on the "download" button on the top right of the page. The file will be called OilData.csv. This is not the original dataset -- it has been cleaned using our ETL file.


##**The Data**
###Visualization 1: (Cumulative Production by County)
The following is a visualization of the state of texas representing oil production by county. The Darker the shade of blue, the more production.
